### Basic Information

## 2. Initial Client Relationship: NJ Stars Elite AAU

### Overview

**NJ Stars Elite AAU Basketball** is the first tenant/client using the LEAG Platform. This relationship serves as the proof-of-concept for the platform's multi-tenant capabilities.

### Key Party Information

| Party | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Client Entity** | NJ Stars Elite AAU (or Kenneth Andrade's registered business entity) |
| **Client Contact** | Kenneth Andrade (Owner) |
| **Relationship Type** | Platform licensing + revenue sharing |

### Revenue Structure

#### Phase 1: Platform Fee Model (Current)

| Revenue Stream | Platform Fee (Stryder Labs) | Client Retention (NJ Stars) |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Events & Merchandise Sales | 20% | 80% |
| Coach Services (Private Lessons) | 5% | 95% |

#### Phase 2: Subscription/Usage Model (Future Transition)

The platform fee model will transition to a subscription or usage-based model when:
- The LEAG Platform acquires additional tenants, OR
- Platform revenue from other sources is sufficient to cover development/operational costs

**Proof of Concept Phase:** 6-12 months with NJ Stars as the sole tenant

**Transition Triggers:**
- To be evaluated based on revenue trajectory after proof of concept phase (6-12 months)
- Transition timing to be mutually agreed upon by both parties
- No fixed MRR or tenant count thresholds predetermined
- Periodic reviews (quarterly recommended) to assess platform sustainability

Upon transition, NJ Stars would move to standard platform pricing (subscription tier to be defined).

## 3. Equity/Revenue Consideration: Kenneth Andrade / NJ Stars

### Proposed Revenue Interest (LEAG Platform Only)

As recognition of NJ Stars' role as the founding client and development partner, the following consideration is proposed:

**IMPORTANT:** This equity/revenue interest is specifically tied to the **LEAG Platform product only**, NOT to Stryder Labs LLC as a whole. Stryder Labs may pursue other ventures, products, or services that would not be subject to this arrangement.

**Trigger Event:** Upon completion of the Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition (platform fee phase-out)

**Revenue/Profit Interest Grant:**
- **Recipient:** Kenneth Andrade personally, OR the NJ Stars registered business entity (to be determined)
- **Amount:** 3-5% of LEAG Platform net revenue/profits (exact percentage and structure to be finalized)
- **Scope:** Limited exclusively to revenue generated by the LEAG Platform
- **Type:** Profit interest or revenue royalty (NOT equity in Stryder Labs LLC itself)
- **Duration:** Perpetual OR time-limited (to be determined)

### Conditions for Revenue Interest Grant

The revenue interest grant is contingent upon:
1. NJ Stars remaining an active, paying client through the transition period
2. No material breach of the client agreement by NJ Stars
3. Execution of appropriate membership interest purchase agreement
4. [Any additional conditions]

### Alternative Structures to Consider

1. **Profit Interest:** Instead of direct equity, grant a profit interest that only participates in future appreciation
2. **Phantom Equity:** Provides economic benefits of ownership without actual ownership
3. **Warrant/Option:** Right to purchase equity at a fixed price in the future
4. **Revenue Royalty:** Ongoing small percentage of platform revenue instead of equity
