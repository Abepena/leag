**To:** [Lawyer's Name]
**Subject:** Need your help setting up an LLC - Stryder Labs

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because I'm finally ready to make things official with a business I've been building.

**The short version:** I need to set up an LLC called **Stryder Labs** - it's a tech company that will own a SaaS platform I've been developing for youth sports organizations (think team management, e-commerce, member portals, etc.).

**Why now:** I've got my first client ready to go (an AAU basketball team in New Jersey), and I want to get the legal structure in place before any money starts flowing. Ideally I'd like to get this done ASAP - December if possible.

**The slightly complicated part:** My first client (Kenneth Andrade, owner of NJ Stars Elite AAU) is essentially a development partner - he's been working with me to build this thing out. We agreed on a 20% platform fee for now, but I want to eventually transition him to a subscription model. When that happens, I'd like to give him a small cut (3-5%) of the **LEAG Platform revenue specifically** - NOT equity in Stryder Labs itself, since I might do other things under that umbrella.

I put together a doc with all the details - company info, the deal structure with Kenneth, IP considerations, questions I have for you, etc. Take a look when you get a chance and let me know what you think.

**Main things I need help with:**
1. LLC formation (Florida vs Delaware? S-Corp election?)
2. Operating agreement
3. Platform services agreement with NJ Stars
4. Structuring Kenneth's revenue interest properly
5. IP assignment (I've been coding this for a while, need to transfer it to the LLC)

Let me know your availability and what this would look like cost-wise. Happy to hop on a call whenever works for you.

Thanks man, really appreciate it!

Abe
